# Canonical Agents

Agent definitions in their canonical, harness-neutral form. One Markdown file per agent.

Each declares what it needs and must not do in this repository's vocabulary; a harness adapter translates that. A human
edits the canonical file, and an adapter is generated from it, never edited in place.

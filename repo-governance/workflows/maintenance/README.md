  Use after finishing a task, plan, or investigation that created scratch files, branches, or worktrees, when planning
  dependency bumps or a release, or when sweeping rules for reductions.

# Maintenance Workflows

Work produces debris: scratch files, reports, branches, worktrees, generated output. None of it is a mistake while the
work is happening. All of it is a mistake once the work is done.

A repository also drifts while nobody works in it: dependencies age and releases wait. The rest of these workflows keep
it current and releasable. The propagations that write rules and documents sit in [`quality/`](../quality/README.md),
beside the gates that judge them.

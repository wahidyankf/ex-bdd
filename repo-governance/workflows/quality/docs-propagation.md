# Docs Propagation

## Contract

The `docs` family's sole writer, under [Sole-Writer Propagation](../../development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md).

## Scope

Every human-facing document: each README, the documentation and specification trees, documents inside projects, the
[standard files][repository-documentation-files], and a plan's documents where they describe the repository. Governance
and agent instructions stay with [Rules Propagation](rules-propagation.md). A handed-over ledger narrows the scope to
what its rows require.

## Executor

`docs-fixer`, loading the `authoring-documentation` skill.

## Row Verification

A row closes when the document no longer holds the state the row names, every command it shows ran or is marked not
exercised, and the repository's checks exit 0. Each ledger row ends `resolved`, `not-resolved`, `not-applicable`, or
`needs-decision`, with evidence.

## Family Rules

### Entry

A change about to [land](../../conventions/structure/plans/009-portability.md#what-landed-means) alters what a
document's reader relies on, a document is added, moved, or deleted, or the [Docs Quality Gate](docs-quality-gate.md)
hands over findings. Entry is automatic: whoever makes the change starts here, unasked. Edits inside one run start no
second. Formatting, links, indexes, and word budgets stay with the repository's checks; this workflow runs them and adds
none.

- `change` (`string`, required): the revision range or working-tree change.
- `findings` (`file`, optional): a handed-over, frozen ledger.

### Sequence

1. **Freeze the inputs:** the change, any ledger, the revision, and uncommitted paths. A material change ends the run as
   input changed, never restarting.
2. **Find what went stale.** Search the scope for every name, path, command, flag, version, and interface the change
   removed, renamed, or redefined; each ledger row is an item too.
3. **Remove what is obsolete.** A document describing something the repository no longer has is deleted with every link
   and index entry to it; still-true unique meaning moves to its canonical home first.
4. **Keep each fact in its one home.** The root README orients; a [project README][project-readmes] and an
   [index](../../conventions/structure/directory-indexes.md) follow their conventions; a page serves one mode per
   [Documentation Architecture][documentation-architecture]. A summary links one level down to its detail, and a fact
   with a canonical home is linked, never copied.
5. **Write for a newcomer.** Each affected document opens by telling a newcomer what it is and why it matters, shows the
   next step without assuming the layout, and leaves no undefined term or skipped prerequisite, per [README
   Quality][readme-quality] and [Content Quality][content-quality], never a readability score.
6. **Run what is safe to run.** Execute every command and example an affected document shows through the repository's
   declared entry point, never one that touches a production or shared system, publishes, spends, needs a secret, or
   cannot be undone; the document says plainly it was not exercised.
7. **Treat specifications as canonical.** Refresh their readability, navigation, and links; when one disagrees with the
   implementation, the partial outcome applies.
8. **Change only what is stale, missing, or obsolete.** Never rewrite accurate prose, invent behaviour, or fold in
   unrelated work.
9. **Verify once** with the repository's existing checks, repairing only failures this run caused, and only while their
   count strictly decreases, per [Bounded Convergence](../../development/workflow/bounded-convergence.md).
10. **Hand delivery to the caller.** The run never commits; repairs land with the change they explain, a handed-over
    ledger's as their own change.

### Exit

Outputs: `status` (`enum`: `no-change`, `landed`, `partial`, `input-changed`), `updated-docs` (`file-list`), `removed`
(`file-list`), and `not-run` (`record`, each command left unexecuted and why).

Partial outcome: when the code, a specification, or the audience is ambiguous or they disagree, that document stays
unchanged with its row `needs-decision`, asked of its owner; the rest lands. A rerun on unchanged inputs changes
nothing.

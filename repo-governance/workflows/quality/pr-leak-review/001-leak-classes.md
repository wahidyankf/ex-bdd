# Leak Classes

A leak review judges three classes and no others. Each maps to the count of the same name in its verdict.

- **`secret_or_private_value`** — A finding is: a real credential or other value that grants access — in any
  environment, with staging and production credentials named explicitly because they reach real data and real users;
  Owning convention: [No Secrets in Tracked Files](../../../conventions/security/no-secrets-in-tracked-files.md)
- **`protected_environment_property`** — A finding is: a value that belongs in environment or secret storage, such as a
  connection string or a non-public environment's endpoint or account identifier; Owning convention: [Environment
  Variable Contract][environment-variable-contract]
- **`machine_specific_absolute_path`** — A finding is: anything identifying the machine it came from: an absolute home
  path such as `/Users/<name>/`, `/home/<name>/`, or `C:\Users\<name>\`, a username, a hostname, a private address;
  Owning convention: [No Machine-Specific Values](../../../conventions/security/no-machine-specific-values.md)

## Real Means Real

Any real credential is a finding, whichever environment it belongs to: a development key that works is still a key, and
deciding which environment a token reaches is guesswork the review does not attempt. Only a value that is unmistakably
synthetic passes.

## What Is Not a Leak

- A home-relative path such as `~/notes`. It names no account and resolves on every machine.
- A repository-relative path, or a documented placeholder such as `<name>` or `<repository-path>`.
- Public identifiers, documented public values, and loopback addresses in test configuration that targets a local
  service.
- Synthetic fixtures that are unmistakably synthetic.

A name containing `key`, `token`, `secret`, or `prod` is not evidence alone. A candidate is a finding only when shape
and context show the value is real.

## History Is the Subject

Every commit bound for the remote is outbound on its own. A value added by one commit and deleted by the next is
published with both, and every clone keeps it. A review therefore reads each commit's additions, its file names, and its
message, never only the range's final files.

The review binds from adoption onward. Content a range does not add is not judged again, and history published before
adoption is out of scope for the review; a leak found there is handled under the owning convention instead.

## The Review Is Itself Published

The audit comment is outbound, per [Public Outbound Safety](../../../conventions/security/public-outbound-safety.md). It
carries only the pinned head, the result, and the counts, so no value can reach it. A reviewer's notes are never
published and never quote a value, because a quoted secret is published again in the record of its discovery. Anything
found is treated as already disclosed.

It is not a security or semantic review. A screen matches shapes; this review reads context, and three classes keep it
small enough for every push and every head.

# Security Conventions

Everything here guards one of three concerns: what enters version history, which no later commit takes back; who may
read real values; and what leaves the repository, which no later deletion recalls.

- **[No Secrets in Tracked Files](no-secrets-in-tracked-files.md)**: where credentials live, whatever the visibility,
  and what remediates a leak
- **[Agent Secret Access](agent-secret-access.md)**: what agents must not open, run, or record around private keys and
  secrets
- **[No Machine-Specific Values](no-machine-specific-values.md)**: keeping one machine's paths, names, and addresses out
  of commits
- **[Public Outbound Safety](public-outbound-safety.md)**: what must be screened before anything is published

# Conventions

A convention records a choice. Two repositories could reasonably decide differently and both be right; what matters is
that one of them decided, wrote it down, and now applies it consistently.

That is what separates this layer from the one above it. A principle explains why something is true regardless of
repository. A convention says which of several defensible options this repository picked.

- **`security/`**: what enters history, who reads real values, what leaves
- **`structure/`**: how files, directories, and documents are shaped and named, and how governance and plans are
  organized

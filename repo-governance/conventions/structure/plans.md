# Plans Convention

A formal plan is a durable, checkable record of intended work. It exists so that someone who was not present when the
work was designed — including a cold executor picking it up months later — can carry it out, verify it, and know when it
is finished.

This entrypoint is deliberately short. The modules below hold the complete rule; each is independently readable and each
is what an adopter's plan validator checks against; the catalog ships none.

## Conditional Conventions

Some plans carry more than every plan does. Each of these applies only when its trigger holds, and each adds to this
convention without restating it.

- **[Plan Specification Changes][plan-specification-changes]**: changes observable behaviour, an interface,
  architecture, or an executable specification
- **[Plan Migrations][plan-migrations]**: moves, copies, normalizes, replaces, or retires data, configuration, or
  structure
- **[Plan UI Design][plan-ui-design]**: creates or materially changes a user interface
- **[Plan Content Corpora][plan-content-corpora]**: authors or restructures a content corpus inside its own folder

## What This Convention Does Not Decide

It does not decide what a repository should plan, how large a plan should be, or which delivery mode — pull request,
direct [landing](plans/009-portability.md#what-landed-means), local-only landing — a repository uses. Those are the
adopting repository's to choose, and the plan system is designed to survive any of them.

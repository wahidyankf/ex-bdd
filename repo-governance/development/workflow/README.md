description: >-
  Indexes the workflow standards that govern how work is bounded, ordered, committed, integrated, deployed, and brought
  to a terminal state, and how a working environment and its toolchain are prepared.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when designing a repeated operation, when committing, integrating, or deploying a change, when preparing an
  environment or toolchain, or when a process has no obvious stopping point.

# Workflow Standards

Standards about the shape of work rather than its subject. Version-control, integration, environment, and toolchain
standards sit alongside them.

## Directory Map

- [Bounded Convergence](bounded-convergence.md) — how a repeated operation is bounded and how it ends, with quality
  gates deferred to their own contract
- [Bounded Convergence Modules](bounded-convergence/README.md) — the modules on loop register and ceiling scorecard
- [Commit Messages](commit-messages.md) — the Conventional Commits format and type list, and why types never decide
  commit boundaries
- [Dependency Bump Policy](dependency-bump-policy.md) — exact pins, the long-term-support, soak, and waiver paths,
  vulnerability clearance, and the written cutoff
- [Integration Path](integration-path.md) — the branch or direct route to the trunk, branch lifespan, one worktree per
  task, reconcile, and cleanup
- [Native-First Toolchain](native-first-toolchain.md) — pinned native toolchain managers, the idempotent health command,
  what repair may change, and when to revisit
- [No Destructive Git Operations](no-destructive-git-operations.md) — approval outside bounded authorized task sync and
  additive equivalents for destructive effects
- [Authorized Task Sync Modules](no-destructive-git-operations/README.md) — owned sync, recovery, reviews, and gates
- [Pull Request Body](pull-request-body.md) — what a body states, the trunk-state claim, and rewriting the body whenever
  the head moves
- [Pull Request Merge](pull-request-merge.md) — the merge preconditions, the recorded landing method, the no-bypass
  rule, draft readiness, and who holds merge authority
- [Quality Gate Contract](quality-gate-contract.md) — the bounded, advisory cycle every quality gate runs: roles,
  inputs, scoring, termination, verdicts, ledger
- [Quality Gate Contract Modules](quality-gate-contract/README.md) — the modules on inputs, sequence, verdicts, and
  ledger
- [Remote Status Polling](remote-status-polling.md) — the spacing of status reads, no streaming watches, trigger
  discipline, and recovery from a rate limit
- [Sole-Writer Propagation](sole-writer-propagation.md) — the one writer per gate family, its eight shared rules, and
  the family file shape
- [Upstream Tool Defects](upstream-tool-defects.md) — handling pinned upstream tool defects

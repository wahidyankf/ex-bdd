  Indexes the ordered modules that hold the red, green, and refactor steps with their evidence, test design, regression
  tests for fixes, and intermittent failures for test-driven development.
when_to_use: >-
  Use to locate the module covering one part of test-driven development, such as a valid red, a bug fix's test, or a
  flaky test.

# Test-Driven Development Modules

The modules below are read in sequence and carry the detail behind the
[Test-Driven Development](../test-driven-development.md) entrypoint.

- **[Cycle and Evidence](001-cycle-and-evidence.md)**: valid red, green, and refactor steps, cycle size, harness reds,
  and recorded evidence
- **[Test Design](002-test-design.md)**: arrange-act-assert, test properties, names, one logical assertion, and derived
  sets
- **[Regression Tests](003-regression-tests.md)**: a reproducing test with every fix, its form by defect, and planned
  fixes
- **[Intermittent Failures](004-intermittent-failures.md)**: confirming the same code, the required response, and the
  remedies that only hide it

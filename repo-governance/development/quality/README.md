description: >-
  Indexes the quality standards: how work is verified and what counts as evidence that it holds; how code is designed,
  tested, contracted, checked, delivered, and kept accessible; and the rules a language or framework stack adds.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when deciding how a change will be verified, or what a piece of evidence has to contain, or which design, code,
  testing, contract, delivery, accessibility, stack, or repository-check standard applies.

# Quality Standards

Verification standards. They answer what proves a change works, and what a proof has to look like to be worth anything
to someone who was not there when it was produced. Code, testing, contract, stack, and check standards sit alongside
them.

## Directory Map

- [Architecture and Contracts](architecture/README.md) — the public contract and its compatible and breaking changes
- [Checks and Gates](checks/README.md) — lint strictness and documented waivers
- [Code](code/README.md) — dependency selection, and type and boundary safety
- [Evidence](evidence/README.md) — finding criticality and confidence ratings
- [Stacks](stacks/README.md) — the Elixir standard and the repository adapter recording its decisions
- [Testing](testing/README.md) — test layers and gates, test-first work, meaningful coverage, and test doubles
